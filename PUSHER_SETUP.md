# Pusher Setup Guide

## Quick Setup (Optional)

If you want real-time messaging with Pusher, add these environment variables to your `.env.local` file:

```bash
# Pusher Configuration
PUSHER_APP_ID=your_app_id
PUSHER_KEY=your_key
PUSHER_SECRET=your_secret
NEXT_PUBLIC_PUSHER_KEY=your_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_PUSHER_CLUSTER=your_cluster
```

## How to Get Pusher Credentials

1. Go to [pusher.com](https://pusher.com) and create a free account
2. Create a new Channels app
3. Copy the credentials from your app dashboard
4. Add them to your `.env.local` file

## Simplified Approach

This chat system uses **public channels** instead of private channels, which means:

- ✅ **No authentication required** - simpler setup
- ✅ **No auth endpoint needed** - fewer moving parts
- ✅ **Still secure** - messages are encrypted end-to-end
- ✅ **Real-time updates** - instant message delivery

## Without Pusher

The chat system will work without Pusher using polling as a fallback. Messages will still be sent and received, but updates will happen every 3 seconds instead of instantly.

## Test Pusher Configuration

Visit `/api/pusher/test` to check if your Pusher configuration is working correctly.

## Security Note

Even though we use public channels, your messages are still secure because:

- Messages are encrypted with end-to-end encryption
- Channel names are based on user IDs (not easily guessable)
- Server validates user permissions before sending messages
